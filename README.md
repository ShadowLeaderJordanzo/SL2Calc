# TO DO 
    make classes for resistance
    make classes for Health/FP
    make a 'Person' class, probably hold things like SWA, hit, evade maybe health/fp res
        i could probably just have everything under person but that'd make it more of like a global storage for stuff
    
    make stats influence their respective things
        have aptitude increase invested by 1 for everything
        make shift click open an input value box

    add race selection that changes bases
        add class/sub class
            add food
