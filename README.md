# TO DO 

	make shift click open an input value box

	add feature to let overflow stas so you can have -

	folder that parse text files and auto adds weapons to it when initialized

	this could work for races/classes and weapons, as it is currently a database handles all of this stuff, although i've never packaged things so im unsure how that'd work

# Refactors
redo balloons, its deprecated and ugly

various things, likely all classes could be touched up
